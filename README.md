# REAL-TIME INFRARED DRONE DETECTION
Final Project Documentation ,Electrical and Electronics Engineering , Tel Aviv University ,2025

## Algorithm Overview (YOLOv8)

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time, one-stage object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. The algorithm divides the input image into a grid and simultaneously predicts bounding boxes and their associated class probabilities for each cell. 

Key features of YOLO include:
- **Speed:** YOLO processes images at high frame rates, making it suitable for real-time applications like drone detection.
- **End-to-End Training:** The algorithm is trained end-to-end, optimizing both the bounding box prediction and classification tasks in a single step.
- **Unified Framework:** YOLOâ€™s single neural network design makes it efficient and compact compared to two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN.

## Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed. You can download it from the official Python website.

### 1. Install Python 3.11

Verify the installation by entering the following command in the CMD:
```
python --version
```
You should see output similar to:
```
Python 3.11.x
```
### 2. Install Required Libraries

Install the core libraries for the project:
```
pip install numpy ultralytics
```
### 3. Install CUDA (Optional but **recommended**, for GPU Acceleration)
#### Why Use CUDA for GPU Acceleration?

Using CUDA with an NVIDIA GPU provides several key advantages:
**1.Faster Computations:** GPUs are optimized for parallel processing, making them much faster than CPUs for tasks such as training deep learning models or running inference in real time.
  
**2.Improved Performance for YOLO:** Running YOLOv8 on a GPU significantly improves its detection speed, allowing for real-time performance, which is crucial for applications like drone detection.

**3.Efficient Resource Utilization:** CUDA allows you to fully utilize the GPU's processing power, offloading compute-intensive operations from the CPU and improving overall system performance.
