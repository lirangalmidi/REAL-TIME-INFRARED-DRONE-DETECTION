# REAL-TIME INFRARED DRONE DETECTION
Final Project Documentation ,Electrical and Electronics Engineering , Tel Aviv University ,2025
## Algorithm Overview

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time, one-stage object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. The algorithm divides the input image into a grid and simultaneously predicts bounding boxes and their associated class probabilities for each cell. 

Key features of YOLO include:
- **Speed:** YOLO processes images at high frame rates, making it suitable for real-time applications like drone detection.
- **End-to-End Training:** The algorithm is trained end-to-end, optimizing both the bounding box prediction and classification tasks in a single step.
- **Unified Framework:** YOLOâ€™s single neural network design makes it efficient and compact compared to two-stage detectors like Faster R-CNN.
